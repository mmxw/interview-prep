1. Explain event delegation.

2. Explain how `this` works in JavaScript.
  * runtime binding: 
      - the value of `this` is determined by how a function is called. 
      - it can't be set by assignment during execution, and could be different each time the function is called
      - bind() in ES5: set the value of a function's `this` regardless of how it is called
      - arrow function in ES5: doesn't have their own `this` binding, but retains the `this` value of the enclosing lexical context 
  * strict vs. non-strict mode: 
      - in nonâ€“strict mode, `this` is always a reference to an object 
      - in strict mode `this` can be any value
      - In the global execution context (outside of any function), `this` refers to the global object whether in strict mode or not.

Coding questions
Make this work:
duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
Create a for loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at multiples of 5 and "fizzbuzz" at multiples of 3 and 5
What will be returned by each of these?
console.log("hello" || "world")
console.log("foo" && "bar")
